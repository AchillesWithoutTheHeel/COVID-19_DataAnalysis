Given is the Logarithmic Plot of all the new confirmed cases (within one week) against all the cases. This plot gives a much better understanding of the pandemic's Trajectory, hence it makes it easier to predict the future trajectory just by looking at it. Since by looking at an exponential function graph one can't predict when the increasing nature of it will come to an end.
